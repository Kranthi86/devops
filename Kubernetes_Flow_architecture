Flow of Kuberenetes Architecture :
user wants to deploy an application ->
kubectl -> Kubeserver API -> ETCD
                          -> Scheduler - scheduled application to slavenode-1
scheduling -> Scheduler told slavenode-1 is ready for application
kubeserver API -> sent request to Kubelet service for Slavenode1
scheduler will tell to start application on Slavenode1
once application is started -> kubelet will send communication back to Kube server API that application is now up and ready. -> ETCD entry will get updated by Kube server API that application is up and ready.


user wants 3 containers of application at any point of time -> controller manager(replication controller) -> scheduler that user wants 3 pods to be up at all time ->
